* Link-level header length -- shouldn't assume it's 16. Often it isn't.

* PNG files.

* More intelligent layout algorithm for images.

* Portability / bug fixes.

* Memory leaks? Buffer overruns?

* User-specified BPF filters.

* Control verbosity.

* Option to save images by clicking on them.

* Parse JPEG files properly -- the lame memstr(..., "\xff\xd9") thing is
  broken and should be done right. At the moment, some JPEG files get
  truncated in a really lame way.

* Fix issues to do with the display child outliving the capture process, or
  vice-versa.

* Drop privileges after starting up pcap.

* Turn it into an X screensaver (insane idea, but hey...).
