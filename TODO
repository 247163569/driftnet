TODO for driftnet
$Id: TODO,v 1.8 2002/06/01 17:39:11 chris Exp $

* PNG files.

* More intelligent layout algorithm for images.

* Memory leaks? Buffer overruns? Static-sized buffers.

* Parse JPEG files properly -- the lame memstr(..., "\xff\xd9") thing is
  broken and should be done right. At the moment, some JPEG files get
  truncated in a really bad way. An alternative is to store more state for
  JPEG files, and do special parsing when we know a connection has closed.

* More portability / bug fixes.

* Web-based version. Server push? Feedback problems.

* `Bogus image' problem after running for a while?

* Safe(r) setuid operation.

* Drop privileges after starting up pcap.

* There's a problem with the stream capture code if the final TCP packet
  arrives before a packet from earlier in the stream: driftnet will kill the
  connection before seeing the trailing data. Should fix this by producing a
  map of which bits of the stream we have.
