Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF
images for display. It is a horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be
used by anyone anywhere.

To compile, type `make' and fix the errors which get displayed. Driftnet is
at a very early stage of development and probably won't work for you at all.
To make it work, you'll need a directory called /tmp/imgdump.

Driftnet is licensed under the GNU GPL. See the file COPYING in the
distribution.
