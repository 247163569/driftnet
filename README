Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF
images for display. It is a horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be used
by anyone anywhere.

To compile, type `make' and fix the errors which get displayed. Driftnet is at
a very early stage of development and probably won't work for you at all. To
make it work, you'll need a directory called /tmp/imgdump.

Driftnet needs to run with sufficient privilege to obtain raw packets from the
network. On most systems, this means running it as root.

If you find this program entertaining, you might want to help me develop it.
The TODO file contains a list of yet-to-be-done ideas.

Driftnet is licensed under the GNU GPL. See the file COPYING in the
distribution.
