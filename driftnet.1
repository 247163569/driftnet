.SH NAME
driftnet - capture images from network traffic and display them in an X window.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdriftnet\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfilter code\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDriftnet\fP watches network traffic, and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF
images for display. It is an horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be
used by anyone anywhere. It has been described as `a graphical
.BR tcpdump (8)',
`\fIEtherPeg\fP for Unix', and called all sorts of nasty names by people on
.IR Freshmeat .

Images may be saved by clicking on them.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-h\fP
Print a summary of usage.
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP
Listen to packets on \fIinterface\fP. By default, \fBdriftnet\fP will try to
pick up traffic on all interfaces, but this does not work with all versions of
.BR pcap (3);
on such systems, an interface must be specified. On some systems, \fBdriftnet\fP
can only use promiscuous mode if an interface is specified.
.TP
\fB-p\fP
Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.
.TP
\fB-v\fP
Print additional details of packets captured to the terminal.
.TP
\fB-a\fP
Operate in `adjunct mode', where \fBdriftnet\fP gathers images for use by
another program, such as Jamie Zawinski's \fBwebcollage\fP. In this mode, no
window is displayed; images are captured and saved in a temporary directory,
and their names written on standard output.
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fInumber\fP
In adjunct mode, silently drop images if there are more than \fInumber\fP in
the temporary directory. It is assumed that another process will delete images
which it has processed.
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdirectory\fP
Use \fIdirectory\fP to store temporary files. \fBDriftnet\fP will clear this
directory of its own temporary files on exit, but will not delete the directory
or any other files.
.TP
\fB-x\fP \fIprefix\fP
The filename prefix to use when saving images, by default `driftnet-'.
.TP
\fIfilter code\fP
Additional filter code to restrict the packets captured, in the libpcap
syntax. User filter code is evaluated as `tcp and (\fIfilter code\fP)'.
