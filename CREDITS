Thanks to the authors of EtherPEG, for a cool idea, and to Eric Richardson,
whose website brought it to my attention.

Theo Honohan and Benjamin Ritcey assisted me in tracking down some bugs.
Others certainly remain.

Jamie Zawinski for helpful suggestions and webcollage integration.

Eric Dobbs for fixing some portability issues and getting driftnet running on
Solaris and BSD systems.

Rob Timko and Joshua Wright for getting Driftnet working on wireless networks
and reading decrypted data from Kismet.
